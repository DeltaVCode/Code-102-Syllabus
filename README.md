# Code 102 Syllabus

Welcome to Code 102! In this class, you'll get your first taste of programming and the JavaScript language.

Each class consists of lecture time and lab time. During lecture, we'll introduce fundamental programming concepts and show how to solve problems and build tools using code. During lab, you'll apply those concepts to selected sections of the Khan Academy <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">Intro to JavaScript: Drawing and Animation</a> tutorial. By the end of class, you'll have worked on several sections of the tutorial, and will be well-positioned to reinforce your learning by finishing it on your own schedule.

Below is an overview of the concepts we'll cover each day, and the relevant sections from the tutorial.
